This is a web-based personal finance management program.  My goal is a
system that can:

 - Import _all_ data from institions, including all transaction attributes
   and check images.
 - Import transactions more reliabily than the market leaders.
 - Allow for more advanced queries and summaries of transactions.
 - More easily separate business and personal transactions.
 - Bettar automate categorizing and filing transactions.
 - Encrypted database - file is useless if it falls into the wrong hands
 - Scraping can be run automatically or interactively based on if you want to
   store your password in the database.

The back-end is written in python, exposing an API over HTTP.  There is an
html/javascript front-end for viewing editing transactions.  Loading
transactions is done by python with selenium.

Installation:

Requires: python (tested with 2.6 and 2.7)
          selenium (for the scraper)
          Crypto, PIL and numpy on the back-end
          prtcl is optional, and enhances security.

Backend:
Setup the web/ directory to be web viewable.
(apache) Alias /myfinances/ /usr/local/my/finance/web
Create the database, image, session directories specified in config.py,
make them ownable by the http user (www-data?)
If you don't use https, edit api.js to remove the secure cookies setting.

Create a cron file to clean dead session files:
*/5 * * * * root find /usr/local/finance/session/ -type f -mmin +20 -exec rm \{} \;

Scraper:
I've tested this on a Mac, should also work on Linux.  By default it uses
Chrome, so you'll need to install the chrome webdriver binary or change it
to use your browser of choice.
easy_install selenium
Run ./gettransactions.py in the client directory.  Enter your login username
and password, and it will get a list of accounts to check.  If you don't set
the account's password in the account settings, it will interactively ask
before checking that account.
